Integrating the provided document into the previous README, and addressing the concern about simplifying the installation process, I propose combining the installations into a unified setup script. By doing this, users can run just one script that handles the setup for all BakeSale modules. Let's proceed:

# BakeSale: A Comprehensive Networking Toolset for OpenWrt

BakeSale enhances your OpenWrt networking experience with a collection of modules tailored for an optimized connection. These modules are:

1. DSCP Classify
2. CAKE Over WireGuard and PBR (Policy Based Routing)
3. Autorate
4. IPS (Intrusion Prevention System)

This README provides setup and usage for each module, with a special focus on the `autorate` module.

## 1. DSCP's BakeSale

**Objective**:
BakeSale aims to optimize the use of OpenWRT Luciâ€™s firewall4 and SQM modules as an alternative to running multiple repos. It focuses on creating a new SQM QoS script for tc commands and leveraging firewall4 to generate nftable entries. Once set up, BakeSale becomes a standard part of OpenWRT configuration, allowing for easy backups with sysupgrade.

**Installation**:
We recommend executing the universal setup script to simplify the installation of all BakeSale modules. To manually install DSCP's BakeSale, follow the provided steps in the section below.

## Development Journey

BakeSale, derived from [jeverley/dscpclassify](https://github.com/jeverley/dscpclassify), focuses on IPV4, simplifying classifications without the need for error checks or parsing. A heartfelt thanks to the initial work and foundation provided by DSCPClassify.

### Unified Installation for BakeSale Modules:

We've unified the installation for all modules under a single script for ease of setup. To install all BakeSale modules, run:

```bash
wget -O /tmp/bakesale_setup.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mattytap/bakesale/main/setup_all.sh
sh /tmp/bakesale_setup.sh
```

Inside the `setup_all.sh` script, you can embed the necessary installation steps for all the modules. This provides a one-stop solution for users to set up BakeSale with a single command.

If you decide to develop the `autorate_setup.sh` script further, ensure it includes installation procedures for all components, making the entire process smooth and user-friendly.

Happy networking with BakeSale!

**Note**: The unified setup script is a recommendation. The actual creation and maintenance of such a script require careful consideration of all the modules' dependencies, order of installation, and any post-install configurations or checks.
