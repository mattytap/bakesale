# Files Validation Summary 

## 1. dscpclassify

This is an init script responsible for managing the lifecycle of the `dscpclassify` service. It provides functions to start, stop, and check the service status, as well as to enable or disable the service's automatic start during system boot.

**Key Observations:**

- The script verifies the existence of `/usr/lib/dscpclassify/dscpclassify.sh` before executing it.
- It is well-structured with defined functions for starting, stopping, and checking the service status.
- The script handles enabling and disabling the service's autostart during boot time.

## 2. dscpclassify.sh

This shell script serves as the core of the `dscpclassify` service. Its primary function is to classify network traffic by applying DSCP (Differentiated Services Code Point) values to IP packets, according to rules defined by the user.

**Key Observations:**

- The script imports nftables rulesets stored in the `/etc/dscpclassify.d/` directory.
- It leverages the `conntrack` tool and `nft` command-line utility to manipulate connection tracking sessions and nftables rules, respectively.
- The script uses the `jsonfilter` utility to parse the output of the `ubus` command.
- It performs checks for updates every 30 seconds and applies new rules as needed.
- Correct and tested nftables rulesets in the `/etc/dscpclassify.d/` directory are necessary for the correct functioning of the script and to prevent potential disruption of network traffic.

## 3. 21-dscpclassify

This is a hotplug script designed to respond when a network interface is activated. If the interface is part of a firewall zone and the `dscpclassify` service is enabled, the script will reload the `dscpclassify` service.

**Key Observations:**

- It uses both the `fw4` and `ubus` commands to ascertain if a network interface is part of a firewall zone. This approach may be slightly redundant.
- The availability and correct functioning of `fw4` and `ubus` commands in your OpenWrt installation are essential for this script to work as intended.

## 4. README.md

This Markdown document provides a detailed overview of the service, installation instructions, configuration options, and usage examples. It comprehensively explains the workings of the `dscpclassify` service and guides the user on how to use and configure it.

**Key Observations:**

- It highlights the necessity of having the "layer_cake_ct.qos" script and the 'kmod-sched-ctinfo' package installed for the proper functioning of the service.
- The document points out that the service is compatible with OpenWrt version 22.03 and above. Therefore, the user should verify their OpenWrt version before proceeding with the installation.
- Installation and configuration instructions provided in this document are clear and detailed, aiding users in the setup process.

The scripts appear to be well-structured and coherent. With the correct dependencies and environmental setup, they should function as intended. It is recommended to test these scripts in a safe environment before moving to a production setting. Additionally, consider incorporating robust error checking and handling for a more reliable operation in a production setting.
