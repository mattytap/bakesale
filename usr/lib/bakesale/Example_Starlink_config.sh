### For multihomed setups, it is the responsibility of the user to ensure that the probes
### sent by this instance of autorate actually travel through these interfaces.
### See ping_extra_args and ping_prefix_string

dl_if=ifb4eth0 # download interface
ul_if=eth0     # upload interface

# Set either of the below to 0 to adjust one direction only
# or alternatively set both to 0 to simply use autorate to monitor a connection
adjust_dl_shaper_rate=1 # enable (1) or disable (0) actually changing the dl shaper rate
adjust_ul_shaper_rate=1 # enable (1) or disable (0) actually changing the ul shaper rate

min_dl_shaper_rate_kbps=10000  # minimum bandwidth for download (Kbit/s)
base_dl_shaper_rate_kbps=100000 # steady state bandwidth for download (Kbit/s)
max_dl_shaper_rate_kbps=200000  # maximum bandwidth for download (Kbit/s)

# delay threshold in ms is the extent of OWD increase to classify as a delay
# these are automatically adjusted based on maximum on the wire packet size
# (adjustment significant at sub 12Mbit/s rates, else negligible)  
dl_delay_thr_ms=40 # (milliseconds)
ul_delay_thr_ms=40 # (milliseconds)
