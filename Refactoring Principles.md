# Refactoring Principles for OpenWrt Applications

When refactoring an OpenWrt application, adhere to the following principles:

1. **Modularity**: Aim for modular code where each function serves a specific purpose, enhancing understanding, testing, debugging, and code reuse.

2. **Readability**: Prioritize clear and straightforward code over clever or intricate code. Use meaningful variable and function names, and keep functions and files at a manageable size.

3. **Documentation and Comments**: Provide accurate documentation and valuable comments. Comments should explain why the code is doing something, not what it is doing.

4. **Code Optimization**: Avoid premature optimization. First, ensure your code functions correctly, then optimize as necessary, keeping in mind that human time is often more valuable than machine time.

5. **Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling, ensuring the application fails securely and provides meaningful error messages. Full error handling is expected in production, but can be minimal during the development phase.

6. **Consistency**: Maintain consistency in your coding style and conventions. Align with OpenWrt's conventions like the use of `procd` for service management and `uci` or `uci`-compatible configuration files.

7. **Testability**: Write easily testable code. Consider employing test-driven development (TDD), where tests are written first, and then code is written to pass these tests.

8. **Maintainability**: Aim for maintainable code by avoiding duplication, reducing complexity, and keeping the codebase manageable.

9. **Adherence to OpenWrt Conventions**: Adhere to standard OpenWrt conventions such as:
    - **Running as a Service**: Ensure the application can run as a service using OpenWrt's `procd` system.
    - **Configuration Management**: Utilize OpenWrt's Unified Configuration Interface (`uci`) or at least `uci`-compatible configuration files.
    - **Hotplug Mechanism**: Make use of OpenWrt's hotplug mechanism to manage events like network interface up/down events, device insertion/removal, etc.
    - **Logging Conventions**: Use the `log` utility provided by OpenWrt to maintain consistent logging practices.

10. **GUI Compatibility**: Design the application in a way that a GUI frontend, like LuCI, can be easily added later.

Remember, these principles are guidelines designed to aid you in writing better code, but there will always be instances where exceptions might be needed based on the specific requirements of your OpenWrt application.
